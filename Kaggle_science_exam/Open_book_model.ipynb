Mgoksu (@mgoksu) demonstrated how to achieve top public LB=0.807 using Open Book technique. The Open Book method was first presented by JJ (@jjinho) [here][2], then Quangteo (@quangbk) improved RAM usage [here][3], and Anil (@nlztrk) combined with Q&A [here][4]. Radek (@radek1) demonstrated the strength of Q&A [here][5].\n","\n","In my previous notebook [here][6] (i.e. Part 1), we demonstrated how to train a model for Open Book. The model was trained using my 60k Kaggle dataset [here][7]. If you enjoy the notebook you are reading, please upvote the dataset too. Thanks!\n","\n","In this notebook, we will load the trained model output from my previous notebook. We will infer this model after running the code from Mgoksu's public notebook to use Open Book to seach Wikipedia for context. For each test sample in the hidden dataset, we will append Wikipedia context. Then our trained model will infer the multiple choice answer (using both question and appended Wikipedia context). When predicting the answer, this notebook uses a 50% 50% ensemble of the new Q&A model we trained ensembled with Mgoksu's original model.
