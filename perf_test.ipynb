    "This notebook is for perf-testing PyTorch vs TensorFlow with and without GPU on a simple training set so I can figure out the best environment for training models. Here's the setup I used\n",

    "* Fashion mnista data set to train a 9-layer CNN\n",
    "* Miniconda installed and base+script directories added to path; then Python + Pylance + Pylint extensions added to VS Code\n",
    "* PyTorch w CUDA set up per https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/. I had to use pip install (conda install had missing DLLs), and I had to install this before the tensorflow w CUDA via direct ML to get them to both work together.\n",
    "* Tensorflow w CUDA via WSL set up per https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip\n",

    "Overall conclusion: PyTorch w CUDA was the winner by a wide margin, although required a lot more code\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific results when running the code below on various configurations above:\n",
    "1) CUDA was substantially faster than CPU (~4x) on this 9 layer CNN. I saw 9x speed up on a larger unet.\n",
    "2) Tensorflow w CUDA via WSL (the recommended configuration) had problems (see below), so I won't use this again until the tech matures.\n",
    "3) Tensorflow w CUDA via direct ML was better than 1 and 2; good speed up, easy to code, just worked well\n",
    "4) PyTorch trained the fastest. It required 3x more code, but I think this is a good thing as it forces me to think.\n",
    "\n",
    "My experience on tensorflow CUDA via WSL (tensorflow.org's recommended configuration for Windows) was not good:\n",
    "* Setting it up was a PITA\n",
    "* After you are done, there are spurrious warnings about tensorRT and NUMA\n",
    "* WSL eats up a ton of disk space, and worse it eats up a ton or RAM when running, and worst of all it eats 1GB of RAM even when it is not running(!) due to virualization of the operation systems\n",
    "* It ran slower than CPU on my small models and crashed on larger models"
